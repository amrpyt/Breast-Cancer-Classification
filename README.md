# Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Python script for building a predictive model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using logistic regression. The code includes the following steps:

1. **Importing Dependencies**: The necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, are imported.

2. **Data Collection & Processing**: The breast cancer dataset is loaded from scikit-learn, transformed into a Pandas DataFrame, and processed. Descriptive statistics, information about the data, and checks for missing values are performed.

3. **Separating Features and Target**: The features (X) and target variable (Y) are separated.

4. **Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

5. **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is trained using the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and testing data.

7. **Building a Predictive System**: A function is provided to predict the label (benign or malignant) based on input features. An example of usage is demonstrated.

Feel free to explore the code and utilize it for breast cancer classification tasks. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
